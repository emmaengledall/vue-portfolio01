        <p class="col-start-1 row-start-2 pl-10 " >Before begining this blender project, we went through five days of introduction to the program. <br>
We went through the basics, like modelling, working with mesh, how to grap, scale and rotate our assets and place them. <br>
We worked with different kinds of small basic projects, to get comfy using blender! 
later on i settled on going for a more spacy vibe. 
My scene enden up, being a vulcano submerged in lava with a space background. My climber turned into a small robot (named robert) <br>
who found himself in a sticky situation, because his spaceship crashed on the island. <br>
The surroundings were as i mentioned spacy, and the lava also have some emission action going on. <br>
This made the surrounding objekts glow and reflect. <br>
Basically the lava is the most outstanding light source, with creates the wanted gloomy vibe. <br>
The background is a HDR picture, with spacy stars and colors. <br>
The vulcano is made, by using a landscape add-on, and afterwards i added texture, and colored it, to get the desired look! <br>
The lava is made with a ocean modifier, to give it a bumpy look and the texture is a lava-like picture i found using blenderKit.
