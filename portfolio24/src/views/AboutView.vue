  A versatile Frontend Developer, Website Designer, and Coded Designer, driven by a lifelong passion 
  for art and creativity.  <br> <br>
  Drawing, painting, building, and storytelling are not just hobbies but natural expressions of my creative spirit. <br>
  
  In a rapidly evolving technical landscape, being a creative individual opens up boundless opportunities. 
  From 3D-modeling to coding and designing, I thrive on turning ideas into reality.
  My top priority is crafting unique, functional websites and coded solutions tailored 
  to my clients' needs and brand identity. <br> <br>
  I firmly believe that user experience is paramount, and I'm committed to delivering solutions that are both visually
  stunning and intuitively functional. <br>
  Currently, I am pursuing a degree in visual communication at the Danish School of Media and Journalism, specializing in coding. <br>
  Expected to graduate in June 2026, I am eager to continue pushing the boundaries of creativity and technology.</p>
