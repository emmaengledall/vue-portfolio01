        <p class="col-start-1 row-start-2 pl-10 pt-10" > Second time, using processing in a project. <br>
            This time around, coding was used to make postcard designs! <br>
            We had an awesome first try, plotting the postcards using an AxiDraw. <br>
            I quickly decided on the same design as for my last processing expiriment. Beside choosing our own designs, <br>
            the AxiDraw allowed us, to rethink the material we could plot on <br> - which i took advantage of. <br>
            I ended up plotting on both hard paper and glass. Which was amazing! <br>
            The design was made by using brightness() which determined <br>
            the spread and width of the ellipse().
